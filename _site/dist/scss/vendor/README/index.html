<p>Most projects will have a <code>vendors/</code> folder containing all the CSS files from external libraries and frameworks – Normalize, Bootstrap, jQueryUI, FancyCarouselSliderjQueryPowered, and so on. Putting those aside in the same folder is a good way to say “Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my responsibility”.</p>
<p>If you have to override a section of any vendor, I recommend you have an 8th folder called <code>vendors-extensions/</code> in which you may have files named exactly after the vendors they overwrite. For instance, <code>vendors-extensions/_bootstrap.scss</code> is a file containing all CSS rules intended to re-declare some of Bootstrap’s default CSS. This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.</p>
